* Windows: Driver version 358.xx or higher
* Linux:   Driver 358.xx or higher
* CUDA 7.5 Toolkit (optional)

[Windows Configuration Requirements]

[Common to all OS platforms]
* NVIDIA Video Codec samples have pre-built CUDA PTX kernels.  To build the Video Codec SDK samples, it is not
  necessary to download the CUDA toolkit to build.
* To download the CUDA 7.5 toolkit, please go to the following web site:
